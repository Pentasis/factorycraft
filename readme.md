# FactoryCraft

The intitial idea behind this mod is to add a Programmable Logic Controller as close as possible to real-life implementation.
Besides the obvious flexibility it will provide for gameplay, it can also be used as an educational tool.

The PLC can be programmed with either the Ladder Diagram (LD) language (visual) or the Instruction List (IL) language. I tried to keep as close as possible to the IEC 61131-3 standard.
